# Create Intersight Kubernetes Policies and Profile using PowerShell

- Intersight Objects will be created as per file names starting from 01 to 15.
- To create all the policies and profile with one command, run: ./main.ps1 from powershell prompt.
- To individually create the policies and profiles, run: ./<xx_name.ps1>. 
- Note: The Intersight objects are dependent on each other. Hence, the sequence from 01 to 15.
